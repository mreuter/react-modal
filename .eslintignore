# When ESLint is run, it looks in the current working directory to find an .eslintignore file
# before determining which files to lint. If this file is found, then those preferences are applied
# when traversing directories. Only one .eslintignore file can be used at a time, so .eslintignore
# files other than the one in the current working directory will not be used.
